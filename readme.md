# Blogship

A lightweight and fast blogging system.

## Dev

To run both front-end and back-end in _dev mode_ (which reload/restart on changes) use `./run_dev.sh`.<br/>
In this case, the front-end listens on http://localhost:8080 and back-end on port 8081 (all addresses).

If you prefer to have them started in separate terminal windows, use the `run_dev.sh` scripts from their respective locations.

## Use

Go to http://localhost:8080 which is the homepage.

For a quick healthcheck, use http://localhost:8080/system-health-check which involves a minimal interaction 
between the front-end and back-end as a complete round trip.

## Build

There is a script in each part for building what should run in production.
