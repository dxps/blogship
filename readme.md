# Blogship

A lightweight and fast blogging system.

## Dev

To run both front- (`_ui`) and back- (`_svc`) ends in _dev mode_ (reload/restart on changes) use `./run_dev.sh`.

Otherwise, if you prefer to have them started in separate terminal windows, just use the `run_dev.sh` scripts
from their respective locations.

## Build

There is a script in each part for building what should run in production.
